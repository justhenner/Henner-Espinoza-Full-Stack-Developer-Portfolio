                <p>
                    Hi! I'm Henner, a Full Stack Web Developer with a varied skill-set. I studied business and marketing during my undergraduate years, and went on to work at one of the largest investment banks in the country where I navigated between the marketing and sales divisions. After stepping away from my corporate role in 2018 I pursued my graduate studies in Madrid (si, hablo espa√±ol!). When away from the screen I'm likely teaching yoga, helping gym-goers better use equipment at hand or being walked by my dog.
